# The tidyverse

---

## Base R Syntax


--

```{r}
table(nhanes$education,
      nhanes$phys_active)
```

--

- Starts with function, data frame in parentheses

--

- Uses dollar sign notation (data_frame$variable)

--

- Requires repeating data frame name each time you call it

---


## Tidyverse Syntax



```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(education, phys_active)

```

--

- "data frame first, data frame once" - [Alison Hill](https://ohsu-conj620.netlify.com/slides/cm012.html#20)

--

- Uses the pipe (%>%) to chain together a series of functions



---

class: center, middle

## The pipe

![](images/pipe.png)

---

### The pipe

Using the pipe, we can start with a data frame and then conduct a series of functions all at once. Read each pipe as "then."

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  filter(survey_yr == "2009_10") %>% 
  group_by(education) %>% 
  summarize(mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE))

```

--

*Keyboard shortcut to add a pipe: command-shift-M (Mac) or control-shift-M (Windows).*

### Your Turn


1. Open the 03-data-wrangling-and-analysis-exercises.Rmd file

--

1. Load the `tidyverse` package

--

1. Import NHANES data to a data frame called `nhanes`
