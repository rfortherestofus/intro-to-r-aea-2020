# Load Packages

Load the `tidyverse` package. 

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Import NHANES Data

Import the NHANES data to a data frame called `nhanes`. 

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



# select

![](slides/images/select.png)

With `select` we can select variables from the larger data frame. 

Use `select` to show just the `marital_status` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



We can also use `select` for multiple variables. 

Use `select` to show `marital_status` and `education`.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

We can `select` a range of columns using the var1:var2 pattern. `select` all the variables from `health_gen` to the end.


```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

We can drop variables using the -var format. Drop the `education` variable.


```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

We can drop a set of variables using the -(var1:var2) format. Drop the variables from `health_gen` to the end.


```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

# mutate

![](slides/images/mutate.png)

We use `mutate` we make new variables or change existing ones. 

Create a **new variable with a specific value**

Create a new variable called `completed_survey` and make all responses to it "Yes". If you want to see this variable easily, add a line where you select only the `completed_survey` variable. Don't forget the pipe (%>%)!

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


Create a **new variable based on other variables**

Create a new variable called `pct_days_phys_health_bad` and calculate it as the percentage of self-reported days of bad physical health in the last 30 days. Remember that the `days_phys_hlth_bad` variable is a measure of the **number** of self-reported days of bad physical health in the last 30 days. Then, use `select` to show the `days_phys_hlth_bad` and `pct_days_phys_health_bad` variables.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Change an **existing variable**

Convert the `weight` variable to pounds by multiplying by 2.205 (it's in kilograms now). Then, use `select` to show only the `weight` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



# filter

![](slides/images/filter.png)

We use `filter` to choose a subset of cases.

Use `filter` to keep only respondents who are divorced. Then, use `select` to show only the `marital_status` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Use `filter` to keep only respondents who are **not** divorced. Then, use `select` to show only the `marital_status` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


Use `%in%` within the `filter` function to keep only those who are divorced, separated, or widowed. Then, use `select` to show only the `marital_status` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Create a chain that keeps only those are college grads (line #1). Then, `filter` to keep only those who are divorced, separated, or widowed. Finally, use `select` to show only the `education` and `marital_status` variables.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



We can use `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` for numeric data. 

Use `filter` to only show those who reported at least 5 days of physical activity in the last 30 days (this is the `phys_active_days` variable). Then, use `select` to keep only the `phys_active_days` variable.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



# summarize

![](slides/images/summarize.png)


With `summarize`, we can go from a complete dataset down to a summary.

Get the mean hours of sleep per night that respondents say they get.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


We can have multiple arguments in each usage of `summarize`.

In addition to calculating the mean hours of sleep per night, calculate the minimum and maximum hours of sleep that respondents reported.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```




# group_by

![](slides/images/group-by.png)


`summarize` becomes truly powerful when paired with `group_by`, which enables us to perform calculations on each group. 

Calculate the mean hours of sleep for females and males using `group_by` and `summarize`.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
````

We can use `group_by` with multiple groups.

Use `group_by` for `gender` and `work` (whether or not respondents are working) before calculating mean hours of sleep.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


# Create a new data frame

Sometimes you want to save the results of your work to a new data frame. 

Create a chain that starts with your `nhanes` data frame, does the following, and saves the result to a new data frame called `mental_health_over_30`:

1. Uses `filter` to only include those age 30 or older
2. Uses `group_by` to create a male and female group
3. Uses `summarize` to calculate a new variable called `mean_bad_mental_health_days` for males and females that calculates the mean number of days of bad mental health (the variable is `days_ment_hlth_bad`).

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Crosstabs

The `tabyl` function in the `janitor` package is mostly used for crosstabs, but you can use it to do frequencies.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade)
```

To do a crosstab, you just add another variable.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) 
```


`janitor` has a set of functions that all start with `adorn_` that add a number of things to our crosstabs. We call them after `tabyl`. For example, `adorn_totals`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col"))
```


We can add `adorn_percentages` to add percentages.


```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages()
```



We can then format these percentages using `adorn_pct_formatting`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) %>% 
  adorn_totals(where = c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0,
                       rounding = "half up") 
```



If we want to include the n alongside percentages, we can use `adorn_ns`.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 0,
                       rounding = "half up") %>% 
  adorn_ns()
```



We can add titles to our crosstabs using `adorn_title`. 

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  adorn_title(placement = "combined")
```




We can also do three (or more) way crosstabs automatically by adding more variables to the `tabyl` function.

```{r}
nhanes %>% 
  tabyl(age_decade, gender, education) %>% 
  adorn_totals(c("row", "col")) %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting() %>% 
  adorn_ns() %>% 
  adorn_title(placement = "combined")

```

# Crosstabs

Sometimes you want your results in a crosstab. We can use the `tabyl` function in `janitor` package to make crosstabs automatically.

Create a crosstab of `gender` and `health_gen`. 


```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

Add a `drop_na` before your line with `tabyl` to get rid of all NAs.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


`janitor` has a set of functions that all start with `adorn_` that add a number of things to our crosstabs. We call them after `tabyl`. For example, `adorn_totals`.

Use the code above and then add totals using `adorn_totals` in the rows and columns.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


We can add `adorn_percentages` to add percentages.

Use the code above and then add percentages using `adorn_percentages`.


```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



We can then format these percentages using `adorn_pct_formatting`.

Use the code above and then format the percentages using `adorn_pct_formatting`. Add arguments so that the percentages are rounded to 1 digit. Note that R uses the "half to even" rounding method by default so if you want to round, say, 14.5 to 15 you must use the `rounding` argument (type ?adorn_pct_formatting in the console to learn more). 

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



If we want to include the n alongside percentages, we can use `adorn_ns`.

Use the code above and then add a line with `adorn_ns` to include the n.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```



We can add titles to our crosstabs using `adorn_title`.

Use the code above and then add a title using `adorn_title`. Use the `placement` argument and see what you get.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```




We can also do three (or more) way crosstabs automatically by adding more variables to the `tabyl` function.

Use the code above, but add a third variable (`age_decade`) to the line with `drop_na` and the line with `tabyl`. You should get a series of crosstabs.

```{r}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```
